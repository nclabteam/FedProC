    Class decimal, a more reliable alternative to float. | v0.1
    ============================================================
            Python's floats (and in many other languages as well) are
    pretty inaccurate. While on the outside it may look like this:

    .1 + .1 + .1

            But on the inside, it gets converted to base 2. It tells
    the computer, "2 to the power of what is 0.1?". The
    computer says, "Oh, I don't know; would an approximation
    be sufficient?"
    Python be like, "Oh, sure, why not? It's not like we need to
    give it that much accuracy."
            And so that happens. But what they ARE good at is
    everything else, including multiplying a float and a
    10 together. So I abused that and made this: the decimal
    class. Us humans knows that 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Well, most of us
    anyway but that's not important. The thing is, computers can
    too! This new replacement does the following:

            1. Find how many 10 ^ n it takes to get the number inputted
                    into a valid integer.
            2. Make a list with the original float and n (multiplying the by
                    10^-n is inaccurate)

            And that's pretty much it, if you don't count the
    adding, subtracting, etc algorithm. This is more accurate than just
    ".1 + .1 + .1". But then, it's more simple than hand-typing
    (.1 * 100 + .01 * 100 + .1 * 100)/100
    (which is basically the algorithm for this). But it does have it's costs.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    BAD #1: It's slightly slower then the conventional .1 + .1 + .1 but
        it DOES make up for accuracy

    BAD #2: It's useless, there are many libraries out there that solves the
            same problem as this. They may be more or less efficient than this
            method. Thus rendering this useless.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    And that's pretty much it! Thanks for stopping by to read this doc-string.
